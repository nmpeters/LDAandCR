# LDAandCR code

Two R scripts are included with sample data to create a Linear Discrminant Model and a Capture-Recapture analysis. The LDA is to be run first on sample carcass data with appropriate covariates added.

Then, once the LDA is created and validated, the output dataframe should have additional information added before using in the Capture-Recapture model. We have left out this sample data as it conatins sensitive details, but provide sample data later on in the capture-recapture code for use. 
Output data from the capture-recapture analysis is also given (as run time is long) and exploratory code for plots and chains provided at the end of the capture-recapture script.
